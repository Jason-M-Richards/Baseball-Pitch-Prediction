# MLB-Pitch-Prediction
## Introduction

As an avid watcher of professional baseball, it is becoming more apparent that statistical data not only helps managers in making decisions, it has improved the consumption of the game. We can now get instantaneous visuals of where a pitch ends up, the trajectory of a ball going out of the park, and even probabilities of scoring based on the positions of runners and the number of outs. 

The goal of this project is to test the theory that pitches can be predicted based on the game situation. The implications of a successful outcome could lead to additional value to game consumption, or even a mobile application that would tell a user what pitch to predict based on the situation of the game (i.e.: runners on bases, inning, outs, pitch count, score, batter, pitcher, etc.).
